            <h3> George Raymond Richard Martin</h3>
           
            <p> George R.R. Martin, in full George Raymond Richard Martin, original name George Raymond Martin, (born September 20, 1948, Bayonne, New Jersey, U.S.), American writer of fantasy, best known for his Song of Ice and Fire series (1996... ), a bloody saga about various factions vying for control of a fictional kingdom. Martin attended Northwestern University and graduated with bachelor's (1970) and master's (1971) degrees in journalism. He had been an aficionado of science fiction and fantasy literature since childhood, and he sold his first short story in 1971. Having received conscientious objector status during the Vietnam War, Martin fulfilled his alternative military service by volunteering for a legal assistance organization in Chicago while earning his living as an organizer of chess tournaments and writing short fiction. He also frequently attended science-fiction and fantasy conventions. He won a Hugo Award in 1974 for his sci-fi novella “A Song for Lya.” In 1976 he accepted a position teaching journalism at Clarke College in Dubuque, Iowa.</p>
            <p>In 1977 Martin released his first work of full-length fiction, Dying of the Light, about a festival on a planet nearing apocalypse, and two years later he moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, to write full time. He received both the Hugo and the Nebula Award for his novelette Sandkings (1981). That year he also released Windhaven (cowritten with Lisa Tuttle), about a girl who gains the ability to fly, and he followed with two full-length efforts, the vampire novel Fevre Dream (1982) and the rock-and-roll horror tale The Armageddon Rag (1983). Though the latter sold poorly, a producer optioned the film rights. The film was never made but the producer suggested Martin as a writer for a remake of The Twilight Zone series in 1985. He wrote several screenplays for the show before accepting a position as a writer for the TV series Beauty and the Beast (1987-90); he eventually became a producer for the modernized fairy tale. Martin returned to long-form fiction in 1991, having had no luck selling his television pilots and screenplays.</p>
            <p> One of Martin's efforts evolved into A Game of Thrones (1996), the first in what was initially intended to be a trilogy set largely in the imagined Seven Kingdoms of the land of Westeros. The series, while explicitly fantasy, pointedly avoided some of the genre's more saccharine conceits in favour of a bleak realism. Major characters—even sympathetic ones—frequently met grisly ends, and the plots were dominated by the political intriguing and battlefield savagery of those questing for the titular throne. Further installments included A Clash of Kings (1999), A Storm of Swords (2000), A Feast for Crows (2005), and A Dance with Dragons (2011). The series was adapted as an HBO show that aired in 2011-19. Martin contributed scripts for several episodes. The episode “Blackwater,” which he wrote, snagged a 2013 Hugo Award for best short-form dramatic presentation. In addition, he served as one of the show's co-executive producers, and, in that capacity, he won three Emmy Awards (2015, 2016, and 2018) when Game of Thrones was named best outstanding drama series.</p>
            <p> Martin edited numerous sci-fi and fantasy anthologies. One such volume, Dangerous Women (2013), included his novella “The Princess and the Queen; or, The Blacks and the Greens.” It was framed as a chronicle of events in Westeros preceding those detailed in the Song of Ice and Fire series. Martin wrote other prequel novellas, several of which were collected in A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms (2014). In addition, he published Fire & Blood (2018), the first volume in a projected two-part series that tells the history of the Targaryens, one of the powerful families of Westeros. Martin's short stories were compiled in GRRM: A RRetrospective (2003). The Ice Dragon (1980; rev. ed. 2006), a short novel for younger readers originally published in an anthology, told the story of a young girl's quest to tame the mythical beast of the title. The fantasy universe in which it was set was similar to Westeros.</p>
