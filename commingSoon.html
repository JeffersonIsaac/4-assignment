                <h3> Song of fire and blood </h3>
                <p> Fire & Blood is a fantasy book by American writer George R. R. Martin. It tells the history of House Targaryen, a family from his series A Song of Ice and Fire.[2] Although originally planned for publication after the completion of the series,[3] Martin has revealed his intent to publish the history in two volumes as the material had grown too large. The first volume was released on November 20, 2018. </p>
